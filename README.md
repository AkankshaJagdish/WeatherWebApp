# WeatherWebApp

Weather forecasting is crucial for planning daily activities, with various platforms offering diverse presentation styles. 

However, understanding the process of fetching and displaying this data can be a challenging task for students. 

This project showcases a rudimentary weather forecast web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The application utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap API, allowing users to enter their desired city and receive a five-day weather forecast, with steps of 3 hours. 

The project offers a user-friendly interface with options to input city names, initiate the forecast fetch, and display the resulting data, including date, temperature, time and weather description. This hands-on approach provides valuable insights into API usage, data handling, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
